# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

## 📖 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Power BI** to analyze customer retention behavior and identify churn drivers within a telecommunications business dataset.

The dashboard evaluates **7,043 customers** and examines churn patterns across multiple dimensions such as contract type, tenure, service adoption, billing behavior, and customer demographics. The analysis transforms raw customer data into actionable insights that help organizations proactively reduce churn and improve long-term customer retention.

This dashboard enables stakeholders to transition from reactive churn tracking to **data-driven retention strategy planning**.

- One-year contract customers show **11.3% churn**
- Two-year contract customers show only **2.8% churn**

**Business Interpretation:**  
Long-term contracts significantly increase customer retention and reduce churn risk.

- Customers with **49–72 months tenure** show strong retention stability

**Business Interpretation:**  
Customer loyalty strengthens after the first year, indicating onboarding and early engagement are critical retention phases.

**Analysis:**
Customers without additional services show high churn likelihood:

- Internet Service → ~94% churn risk  
- Phone Service → ~90% churn risk  
- Online Security → ~84% churn risk  
- Tech Support → ~83% churn risk  
- Device Protection → ~70% churn risk

**Insight:** Payment method influences customer loyalty.

**Analysis:**
- Customers using **Electronic Check** show the highest churn levels.
- Customers using **Automatic Payments (Credit Card / Bank Transfer)** show lower churn rates.

**Business Interpretation:**  
Automated billing increases customer stickiness and reduces switching behavior.

**Analysis:**
- Customers **without dependents** show higher churn rates.
- **Senior citizens** show comparatively higher churn proportions.

**Business Interpretation:**  
Customers with family commitments tend to maintain longer service relationships.

**Analysis:**
- Paperless billing customers churn more frequently compared to traditional billing customers.

**Business Interpretation:**  
Digitally engaged customers may compare competitors more frequently and switch services faster.
